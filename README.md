# discrete-math-hw

These are my homework assignments, which I wrote in LaTex, for a discrete math course I took at West Valley Community College.  The teacher was Betty Weiss and her West Valley profile can be viewed [here](http://www.westvalley.edu/faculty/weiss.html).

# Coursework

The course covered a range of topics from logic, induction to binary operation and finite state machines.

# Software

I used the MacTex package that can be found [here](https://www.tug.org/mactex/).
